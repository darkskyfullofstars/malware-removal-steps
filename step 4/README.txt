BCUninstaller needs administrator rights to start and function. 
They are needed to access some system functions during application scan, to uninstall applications and to delete leftovers.
Some other functions might also need elevated permissions to function, therefore it’s not possible to run BCU with standard user permissions.

BCUninstaller can detect, manage and uninstall applications from the following sources:

    Normal registered applications (same as Programs and Features and many other uninstallers)
    Hidden/protected registered applications
    Applications with damaged or missing uninstallers
    Portable applications (looks in common locations and on portible drives, configurable)
    Chocolatey packages
    Oculus games/apps
    Steam games/apps
    Windows Features
    Windows Store apps (Universal Windows Platform apps)
    Windows Updates Applications from all of these sources are threated the same - you can filter, export and automatically uninstall them in the same way.

Fast, automatic uninstall

The main feature of BCUninstaller is its ability to fully or nearly fully automate the process of uninstalling multiple applications. 
BCU always attempts to use the application’s original uninstaller to avoid issues found in uninstall managers that blindly remove files to achieve uninstall automation
(e.g. failing to unregister context menu entries or services).

    Uninstall any number of applications in a single batch
    Minimal to no user input is required during uninstallation
    Uninstall multiple items at once to speed up the process (with collision prevention)
    Console interface can automatically uninstall applications based on conditions with no user input
    Quietly uninstall many uninstallers that don’t support silent uninstallation
    Uninstall applications even if they don’t have any uninstallers
    Uninstall applications by window, shortcut or directory
    Can handle crashing and hanging uninstallers
